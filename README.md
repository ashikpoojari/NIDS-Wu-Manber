## Welcome to NIDS WU MANBER

We have proposed a Wu-Manber based multi-pattern matching algorithm on hardware to do signature detection. This implementation doesn’t require any pre-processing. It generates shift table and hash block on the fly. The user should give the signature file, the length of the input data, no of signatures and speed of the design as input. The script will generate the circuit required for this design.
